# Personal Portfolio
## Overview

Welcome to my personal portfolio, where I showcase a selection of projects I've developed throughout my journey.

I have handled both the design and code for this portfolio, which is currently in its third version. The first version was created without the use of pre-processors or frameworks, while the subsequent versions incorporated these technologies. As a result of these iterations, there are some design differences between them.

Furthermore, the portfolio is fully responsive in all its versions.
