#### My Portfolio Website

---

I'm a UX/UI Designer that also writes code.

**The purpose of this portfolio is to be able to present my work, and also show how I write code.**

Currently, there is a mixture of **2 versions**.

+ The *home page*, *projects*, and the *about me* section, use the new solution. It has a different approach relative to the HTML structure, was built with SASS, and also makes use of the bootstrap grid.

+ The *case studies* pages I have in the *archive* section use the old solution. It has a slightly different structure, without any pre-processor.

The entire website is **responsive** and the technologies used are **HTML, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap**.
